egg
explanation:
Chicken is the beginning stage of hen. they are born from the egg. so here comes the question how the egg came at first. according to some theories, animals
started to adapt due to environmental change and due to evolution, new species came to existence. so accordingly, first hen and rooster evolved and then hen
laid fertilized eggs. these eggs gave birth to chickens. hence eggs came before chickens.
